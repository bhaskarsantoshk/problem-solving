# Graphs

## Types of Graphs
- **Undirected Graph:** Edges have no direction.
- **Directed Graph (Digraph):** Edges have a direction.

## Components
- **Nodes (or Vertices):** Fundamental units of a graph.
- **Edges:**
  - **Undirected Edges:** Connections between nodes without a direction.
  - **Directed Edges:** Connections with a specific direction.

## Graph Structures
- **Cycles:**
  - **Undirected Cyclic Graph:** At least one cycle in an undirected graph.
  - **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):** Directed graph without cycles.
  - **Directed Cyclic Graph (DAG):** Directed graph with at least one cycle.

## Paths
- A sequence of nodes where each node is reachable, appears once, and adjacent nodes have an edge between them.

## Degree
- **Degree of a Node:** Number of edges attached to a node.
- **Total Degree (Undirected Graph):** Twice the number of edges (D = 2 * E).

## Directed Graph Degree
- **In-Degree:** Number of incoming edges to a node.
- **Out-Degree:** Number of outgoing edges from a node.

## Edge Weight
- Each edge has a weight, default unit weight is 1.
