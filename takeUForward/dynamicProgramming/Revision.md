## House Robber II - DP on Subsequences

Given a circular array of house values, I split it into two subsequences (excluding either the first or last house). I solved it by finding the max sum of non-adjacent elements for both subsequences using recursion, memoization, and tabulation.

## Frog Jump - DP

For this problem, the goal is to find the minimum energy required for the frog to jump to the last stone, where it can jump either one or two steps. I solved it using recursion, memoization, tabulation, and space-optimized DP to minimize energy at each step.
